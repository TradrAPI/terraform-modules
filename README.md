A collection of terraform modules to standardize the way we deploy infrastructure.

Install:
- [tasks](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

Then run

```bash
task init

With this in place all your commits will be checked for linting and formatting issues,
according to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard
and our [`./commitlint.config.js`](./commitlint.config.js) file.
